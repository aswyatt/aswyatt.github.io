    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a scientific software developer and physicist with deep experience in numerical modelling, data analysis, and optical system design. My work bridges simulation and experiment — building high-fidelity models of ultrafast optical systems, verifying them through precision experimentation, and refining them through tightly integrated analysis pipelines.</p>
  
    <p>My technical focus includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Numerical Modelling:</strong> Simulation of ultrashort optical pulse propagation, nonlinear dynamics, high harmonic generation (gas and solids), optical waveguides, fibre coupling, beamlines, and modal decomposition.</li>
      <li><strong>Experimental Analysis:</strong> Extraction of physical parameters from measured data through model fitting, corroboration between simulation and experiment, and design-validation workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Control & Automation:</strong> Interfacing with translation stages, spectrometers, cameras, power meters, oscilloscopes, and photodiodes; building GUIs for scientific instrumentation using PySide6 and signal-slot architecture.</li>
      <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> Programming for Arduino and Raspberry Pi with MQTT and Node-RED; integrating environmental sensors and automation in experimental setups.</li>
      <li><strong>Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System</strong>:Developed and deployed EPICS-compatible control systems using Python soft IOCs, enabling seamless integration of experimental hardware (e.g. motion stages, sensors, and detectors) into distributed instrumentation frameworks.</li>
      <li><strong>Optical Design & Construction:</strong> Modelling and building pulse stretchers/compressors, optical parametric amplifiers, fibre coupling stages, interferometers, and grazing-incidence XUV imaging systems using both simulation and CAD.</li>
      <li><strong>Ultrafast Optics:</strong> Expertise in phase retrieval, CDI/ptychography, interferometry, and pulse characterisation for ultrashort waveform reconstruction and optical metrology.</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>I’m driven by opportunities that combine deep physical understanding with technical clarity — translating theory into practical systems, and experimental results into insight. Whether developing fast-turnaround simulations or orchestrating hardware for precision measurement, I value clean design, reproducibility, and functionality without compromise.</p>
